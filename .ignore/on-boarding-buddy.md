# Onboarding Buddy

## Time commitment

> 3-5 hrs per week

- Meetings
- Pair programming
- answering slack questions

## Responsiblities

- Not authoritative

### First 30

- 3 meetings a week (MWF)
- 30-60 minutes meeting to

### 30-60

#### Thigns going well

- once a week check in

## Key thoughts

- focuses on getting the candidate onboarded, not upskilled
- Not tech support, but can help with tech problems
- Shield for really obvious questions
  - questions that would make the client ask "What the fuck are they doing on the VSA contract?"
- Guides through the process
- Pair programming is required
